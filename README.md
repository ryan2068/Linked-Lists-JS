# Linked Lists JS

This repository provides a linked list implementation written in JavaScript.  It defines `Node` and `LinkedList` classes and implements methods to append, prepend, insert at a specific index, remove, find a value, and convert the list to an array or string.  I used this project to understand how linked lists work under the hood and to get comfortable with building data structures manually.  There are also simple tests you can run to verify the behaviour of the list methods.
